## WHO WE ARE
[SpazioDati](http://spaziodati.eu){:target="_blank"} works on applying Semantic Text Analysis and Machine Learning models on massive amounts of corporate data to provide services - both B2B and B2C - of Sales Intelligence, Lead Generation, Data Cleansing, and more.
Our main product, [Atoka](http://atoka.io){:target="_blank"}, is currently used by thousands of small and big companies in Italy and abroad, and we plan on expanding to new horizons soon.

## YOUR ROLE AS DATA ENGINEER
We are looking for software developers that are ready to "get their hands dirty" for building a better world (of data, at least), one where information is clean and easily accessible; to achieve such goals is not easy, one should be strict but pragmatic, open-minded but skilled on troubles that are common when dealing with data. We are a multicultural team that loves collaboration, we trust and respect each other, we are "agile enough" and, hard to believe, we all love data. If you are an independent data hacker who wants to work in a young and positive environment we want to hear from you!
