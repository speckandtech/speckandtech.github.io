## WHO WE ARE
[SpazioDati](http://spaziodati.eu){:target="_blank"} works on applying Semantic Text Analysis and Machine Learning models on massive amounts of corporate data to provide services - both B2B and B2C - of Sales Intelligence, Lead Generation, Data Cleansing, and more.
Our main product, [Atoka](http://atoka.io){:target="_blank"}, is currently used by thousands of small and big companies in Italy and abroad, and we plan on expanding to new horizons soon.

## WHO WE LOOK FOR
Our Frontend Team is responsible for creating products on the web which will deliver such large amounts of data to our customers in an accessible way, customise their experience and build ad-hoc solutions for their needs, including integrating our tools in their existing software. We use the latest and greatest tools which fits our needs, such as Django, React, Typescript, Less css preprocessor, testing our code at various levels with pytest, mocha and protractor. We also follow the (quite fast paced) trends in this field by continuously experimenting with new tools, frameworks and languages fearlessly replacing and refactoring existing code when we see fit.

We are looking for software developers that are ready to “get their hands dirty” for building a better world (of data, at least), one where information is clean and easily accessible; to achieve such goals is not easy, one should be strict but pragmatic, open-minded but skilled on troubles that are common when dealing with data. We are a multicultural team that loves collaboration, we are “agile enough” and, hard to believe, we all love data. If you are an independent data hacker who wants to work in a young and positive environment we want to hear from you!
